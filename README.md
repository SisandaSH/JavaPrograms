The municipality of a small town needs a program to calculate the amount payable for water consumption for each home (or business). The rate depends on the number of units of water that were used. The first 20 units are free. A fixed rate of R10 per unit is payable for the additional units if 40 units or less are used. If more than 40 units but not more that 100 units are used, the cost is 1.5 times the fixed rate (for the additional units). If more than 100 units are used, the cost is 2 times the fixed rate (for the additional units). Write a program to input the units used (as a floating point number) and to output the amount payable.
