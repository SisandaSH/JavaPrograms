A big supermarket has the following special offer on all breakfast cereals: Depending on the amount of money
spent by a customer, a certain discount is awarded. The discount is determined as follows:
Amount spent Discount
less than R50 10%
R50 to just under R70 20%
R70 to just under R100 30%
R100 to just under R200 40%
R200 and over 50%
Write a program that inputs the amount spent and determines and displays the discounted price.
