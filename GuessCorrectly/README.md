Write a program to give the user 10 chances to guess a number between 1 and 100.
If the user guesses the number correctly in 10 or less tries (say 7), the program should display the message:
Well done! You got the number in 7 guesses.
Otherwise, the program should display the message:
Tough luck! Your 10 chances are over.
The program must contain a constant called SECRET (of type integer) to hold the number that the user must
try to guess. (You can choose any value for SECRET, say 23.)
Furthermore, the program must use a boolean variable called found which is set to true as soon as the user
guesses the number correctly.
