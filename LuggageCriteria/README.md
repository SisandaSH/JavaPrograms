The maximum mass of luggage allowed on a certain kind of airplane is 10 000.00 kg. Write a program that
inputs the mass of each item of luggage and decides whether the total mass exceeds the maximum load that
the airplane can take.
The program should display an appropriate message to report its finding.
Note that your program will require a while loop to calculate the total mass (use 0 as a the final value to
indicate the end of input), and then it will need an if statement after the loop to determine whether the
total mass is greater than the allowed maximum.
