Sam has a small business which does packaging and posting. Clients come to him with a number of items
(of the same size and shape), and he has to pack them into boxes before posting them to some customer
of theirs. He works as follows: He packs as many of the items in a box as he can, and then calculates how
many boxes he will need, and how many items will be left over (i.e. that wonâ€™t fit into a box).
Write a program to input a number of items, and a number of items that fit in a box. The program should
calculate how many boxes will be needed, and how many items will be left over.
