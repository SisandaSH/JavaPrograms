Your child wants to go to university and you must consider all the options. You state the case as follows to
her: If she obtains 90% of higher, she can go to any university of her choice and you will give her a car. If
she obtains from 75% to 89%, and she earns more than R5 000 during the December holidays, she can also
go the university of her choice and you will give her a car. If she obtains more than 74% but does not earn
enough money, she can study at the university of her choice, but you will not give her a car. If she obtains
less than 75%, but more than 59%, she must study at the nearest university. With less than 60% she cannot
go to university and will have to consider other alternatives.
Write a program to read in your daughterâ€™s average mark, and the amount that she earned in her holiday
job, and display a message indicating which university she may attend.
The program must use a switch statement.
