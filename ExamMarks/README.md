Write a program that inputs 25 exam marks, calculates their average and displays a list of the marks
greater than the average.
Hint: The marks must be input and stored in an array. The total must be calculated as the marks are input.
Once the average has been calculated, each element in the array has to be compared with it; this can be
done with a for loop.
