There are a number of criteria for a toddler being accepted at a particular playschool: (i) The child must be
3, 4 or 5 years old. (ii) The parent must be single. (iii) The parentâ€™s annual income must be less than R60
000. (iv) The parent must be 30 years or younger. Write a program to assess whether the criteria are met.
The program should contain a single if statement that uses boolean variables only for its condition.
